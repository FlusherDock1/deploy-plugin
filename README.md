### Why is This Plugin Needed?

This plugin helps in cases where your remote server (production, staging, etc) does not have the ability to run the standard deployment workflow, either due to lack of computational resources or lack of service by the hosting provider. An example of this is shared hosting, where shell access is limited or composer does not have enough memory to execute.

This plugin is an official extension of the October CMS platform and is free to use if you have a platform license. See [EULA license](LICENSE.md) for more details.
